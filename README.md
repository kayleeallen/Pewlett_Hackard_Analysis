# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to prepare the Human Resources department for the upcoming "silver tsunami".
A large portion of the current employees are approaching retirement age. This analysis will provide insight so the HR 
department can create a plan to effectively manage the large turnover.

## Results

Here are the number of employees retiring soon per department:

There are only 1,940 employees eligible for mentorship.

As you can see, there is a large difference between the number of employees retiring and the number employees available for mentorship.

Due to the shortage of mentors, I would recommend that the HR invest in recruiters as well as alternate training programs 
for new employees.
